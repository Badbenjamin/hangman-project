# Dang, Man!
Dang, Man! is a new version of Hangman, built in react, that excludes the morbid lynching imagery that somehow still is used in this common childrens game. Although the stakes of guessing wrong no longer result in the death of a possibly innocent man, they are still high! You start each round with $6 and lose a dollar for every guess. When you lose your last dollar, "Dang, Man! You're Broke!"


## First Time Setup
npm install

## All Other Times

npm run server

npm start

## Gameplay

Choose your level of difficultly before starting your turn. Mix, the default, includes easy, medium, and hard words all together. Enter your best guess in the form and click submit. You can also skip to the next word. The game is over when the list of words runs out! 

You can add, edit, and delete words on the "Add Word" page, and read a short history of Hangman on the "About" page. 

All of the words I have added are software engineering related. Enjoy!
